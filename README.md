# Waaaat the hell


So basically 🤞🤞, this is going to replace morningSTAR at some point, I didn't want to start with a dirty code base, so I figured I'd start from scratch.

# 🚧Build Instructions🚧

This will have to be run as an app, it uses dynamic routing meaning it's making pages on the fly

`npm run start`
or
`nuxt start`
